"""Roadmap generation workflow.

Implements a LangGraph StateGraph that turns a skill-gap analysis into a stored,
week-by-week learning roadmap. The graph has three nodes executed in sequence:

Step 1 - ``retrieve_courses``
    Takes the employee's ``skill_gaps`` and converts them into a query string.
    Calls the Gemini embedding model (``gemini-embedding-001``) to create a
    768-dimension vector for that query. Runs a pgvector similarity search via
    the Supabase ``match_courses`` RPC and stores the top matching courses in
    ``state["candidate_courses"]``.

Step 2 - ``generate_plan``
    Reads the retrieved candidate catalogue from the state. Builds a prompt
    that includes the employee's current role, target role, existing skills,
    skill gaps, and the available courses. Calls the Gemini generative model
    (``gemini-2.5-flash``) through LangChain with structured output to produce a
    week-by-week plan. The plan references courses only by their ``course_id``
    strings and is stored in ``state["llm_plan"]``.

Step 3 - ``enrich_plan``
    Takes the LLM plan and maps each referenced ``course_id`` back to the full
    course row found in Step 1. Discards any invented course IDs. Builds the
    final ``state["final_plan"]`` dict that matches the API ``RoadmapPlan`` schema,
    with full course objects including ``course_id``, ``course_name``,
    ``provider`` and ``url``.

The final ``final_plan`` dict is returned to the caller (the recommendation
service) which stores it as JSONB in the ``roadmaps`` table.
